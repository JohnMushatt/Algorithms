Q1.3 Bonus question 1 pt. Can you find an arrangement that
     produces a tree whose height is four or prove that one can't exist? 
     
     Answer: {6,2,3,4,5,12,10,9,11,8,7,1}
     
Q1.4 Bonus question 1 pt. Can you find an arrangement that
     produces a tree whose height is five or prove that one can't exist?
    Answer:
	Minimum # of nodes for height 5: N(5) = N(3) + N(4) = 7 + 12 +1 = 20
	It is not possible given the current array size of 12 elements to create and AVL tree with height 4
